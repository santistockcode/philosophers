For philosophers project, part of 42 curriculum, I'm allowed to use (among others), this new functions that I haven't use before:
usleep,
gettimeofday,
pthread_create,
pthread_detach,
pthread_join,
pthread_mutex_init,
pthread_mutex_destroy,
pthread_mutex_lock,
pthread_mutex_unlock


Plase propose a set of miniexercises (estimated time of 4 hours to complete) so that I can progressively understand the use of the functions involved regarding concurrency and threads.
